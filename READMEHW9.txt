Notes:

The graph.h, graph.template, and graphMain.cpp (the main file is only for testing) files are for question 1 while doubletsPuzzle.cpp, doubletsGraph.h, and doubletsGraph.template are for question 2.

for question 1 you need to input the labels of the vertices in the graph class as the parameters for the longestDistance function

for question 2 the doubletsGraph class is only intened to be used with the doubletsPuzzle program.
