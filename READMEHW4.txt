How to run:
1. place all files into the same folder
2. open your console and cd into the folder
3. to run the heapafication operation type:
	g++ hw4.cpp
	./a.exe
4. to run the office hours simulation type:
	g++ officeHoursMain.cpp student.cpp teacher.cpp
	./a.exe

Important Information:
- To test the heapafication operation you must make a binary tree and then pass it into the function. After the function is called you can use the "print()" function to see what the tree looks like. Make sure you enter the correct depth into the second parameter of the print function.

- For the office hours simulation the students are assigned a random priority between 1 and 3 (3 being the highest priority and 2 being the lowest).
