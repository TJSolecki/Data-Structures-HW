How to run:

For the office hours simulation type:
	g++ officeHoursMain.cpp Student.cpp Teacher.cpp
	./a.exe

For the word puzzle program type:
	g++ wordPuzzle.cpp

Notes:
Ensure that the puzzle.txt file does not have an extra line at the end with no characters. If there is, the program will read in the number of rows in the puzzle incorrectly.
