You interact with this program through the console

When you open the program you enter 1 if you want to make a conversion from prefix to infix and 2 if you want to make a conversion from infix to prefix

After you enter 1 or 2 you then enter the infix or prefix equation that you want to convert

For input you may use spaces or no spaces if you are doing infix to prefix but you must use spaces when doing prefix to infix

Your inputs may have numbers of any amount of digits, the following symbols: ()*/+- , and spaces

If you make a mistake when entering an equation please restart the program as if you use backspace while entering your equation it will cause an error
